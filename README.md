# C-Networking-College-Project
This project used the socket library in C to create a networking project that allows a user to join a chat room, create a new chat room, or be randomly assigned a chat room. Once in a room, they can create a username. NOTE: All messages are in color, including system messages.

NOTE: As of 3-12-2025 - This project was a project I have from college. While it should work, I can make no guarentees of functionality. However, I think it is still an interesting project and I had worked quite hard on it back in the day, so this is here for your viewing pleasure. Please feel free to test it out. This was originally tested for functionality in a linux VM.
